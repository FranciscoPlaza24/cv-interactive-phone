            <h1 class="abautme1 moving">About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-text">
                My name is Francisco Plaza and I'm 23 years old. I am passionate about
                programming and technology, and I believe in the power of coding to
                create innovative solutions and make a positive impact in the world.
                Programming is not just a career for me, but a way of life. I love the
                challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of seeing my
                code come to life. I enjoy exploring new programming languages and
                frameworks, constantly expanding my knowledge and skills. As a freelance
                Front-end Developer, I specialize in building responsive and
                user-friendly web applications using modern tools such as React.js,
                Angular, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have experience working on various
                projects, ranging from personal websites to large-scale enterprise
                applications. My goal is to continue growing as a developer, honing my
                craft, and contributing to innovative projects that push the boundaries
                of technology. Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors,
                hiking, and exploring nature. I also love reading tech blogs and staying
                up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech industry. In
                addition to programming, I have a passion for music and play the guitar
                in my free time. I believe in lifelong learning and am always seeking
                new opportunities to challenge myself and grow both personally and
                professionally. My qualities and competencies as a Front-end Developer
                are: Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Strong understanding of
                responsive design principles. Experience with front-end frameworks like
                React.js, Angular, and Vue.js. Knowledge of version control systems such
                as Git. Ability to collaborate effectively with designers and backend
                developers. Attention to detail and a commitment to writing clean,
                maintainable code. Problem-solving skills and the ability to
                troubleshoot issues efficiently. Continuous learning and staying updated
                with the latest industry trends and technologies. Good communication
                skills and the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical
                stakeholders. Creativity and a passion for creating visually appealing
                and intuitive user interfaces.
